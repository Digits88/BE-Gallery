== Description ==

BE Gallery is a simple, responsive WordPress theme for showcasing photos. I'm using it as a replacement for Flickr.

As a Genesis child theme, you must have Genesis theme framework ( http://www.billerickson.net/go/genesis ) to use this theme.

Images are uploaded to posts, which serve as galleries. Posts can be grouped using categories into "sets".

== Installation == 

1. Upload the theme and Genesis
2. Activate BE Gallery
3. Go to Settings > Media. Set Thumbnail to 70x70, Medium to 580x440, and Large to 920x600. You can of course use different numbers, but you might need to change aspects of the layout.
4. Optional: Activate the recommended plugins below.
5. Go to Posts > Add New. Give your new gallery a title, description (in post content), and upload images. They should not be inserted into the post content. Also select a featured image.
