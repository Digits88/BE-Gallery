== Description ==

BE Gallery is a simple, responsive WordPress theme for showcasing photos. I'm using it as a replacement for Flickr.

As a Genesis child theme, you must have Genesis theme framework ( http://www.billerickson.net/go/genesis ) to use this theme.

Images are uploaded to posts, which serve as galleries. Posts can be grouped using categories into "sets".
